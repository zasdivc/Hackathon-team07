1,"The nine-digit geographic code at the end of the geographic names comprises two digits for the province, two for the census agricultural region, two for the census division and three for the census consolidated subdivision. Reference maps provide the geographic boundaries, codes and names for all geographic areas appearing in the data tables. <a href=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/95-630-x/95-630-x2017000-eng.htm"">2016 Reference maps</a> or <a href=""http://www.statcan.gc.ca/ca-ra2011/110006-eng.htm"">2011 Reference maps</a>.""",,,,,,,
2,"Due to confidentiality constraints, the data for one or more geographic areas having very few farms may be combined with the data from another census consolidated subdivision or census division. For the names of the geographic areas amalgamated access the <a href=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/95-630-x/2017000/geo-eng.htm"">2016 Geographic area amalgamations</a> or the <a href=""http://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/ca2011/110005/geo"">2011 Geographic area amalgamations</a>.""",,,,,,,
3,"There are significant refinements in the geographic assignment of agricultural operations and changes in census consolidated subdivision boundaries between censuses. These assignment and boundary changes mean that caution should be taken when comparing the data between censuses. This effect is particularly pronounced when comparing 2016 Census of Agriculture data to previous census data in Prince Edward Island, Quebec and the Northwest Territories.",,,,,,,
4,"Census agricultural regions are composed of groups of adjacent census divisions. Prior to 2016, in Saskatchewan, census agricultural regions were made up of groups of census consolidated subdivisions, but these groups did not necessarily respect census division boundaries.",,,,,,,
