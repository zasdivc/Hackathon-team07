6,"There are significant refinements in the geographic assignment of agricultural operations and changes in census consolidated subdivision boundaries between censuses. These assignment and boundary changes mean that caution should be taken when comparing the data between censuses. This effect is particularly pronounced when comparing 2016 Census of Agriculture data to previous census data in Prince Edward Island, Quebec and the Northwest Territories.",,,,,,,
