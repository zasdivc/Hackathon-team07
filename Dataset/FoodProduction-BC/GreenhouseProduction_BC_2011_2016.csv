1,"The nine-digit geographic code at the end of the geographic names comprises two digits for the province, two for the census agricultural region, two for the census division and three for the census consolidated subdivision. Reference maps provide the geographic boundaries, codes and names for all geographic areas appearing in the data tables. <a href=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/95-630-x/95-630-x2017000-eng.htm"">2016 Reference maps</a> or <a href=""http://www.statcan.gc.ca/ca-ra2011/110006-eng.htm"">2011 Reference maps</a>.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3,"The Yukon, Northwest Territories and Nunavut are not included in Canada totals.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,The data for the Yukon are not included in the national totals because of the different definition of an agricultural operation in the territories and confidentiality constraints.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,The data for the Northwest Territories are not included in the national totals because of the different definition of an agricultural operation in the territories and confidentiality constraints.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,"There are significant refinements in the geographic assignment of agricultural operations and changes in census consolidated subdivision boundaries between censuses. These assignment and boundary changes mean that caution should be taken when comparing the data between censuses. This effect is particularly pronounced when comparing 2016 Census of Agriculture data to previous census data in Prince Edward Island, Quebec and the Northwest Territories.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,"Census agricultural regions are composed of groups of adjacent census divisions. Prior to 2016, in Saskatchewan, census agricultural regions were made up of groups of census consolidated subdivisions, but these groups did not necessarily respect census division boundaries.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,"The number of farms reporting"" does not equal the sum of the parts because farms reporting more than one category (or activity) are only counted once.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,"Operations which exclusively produce tree seedlings for reforestation are outside the scope of the 2016 Census of Agriculture and are therefore not included. Prior censuses may have included their production in other greenhouse products"""," affecting ""total greenhouse area"".""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,"In 2011, some respondents incorrectly reported vegetable plants for sale"" resulting in over-reporting of area in ""Greenhouse flowers"" and ""Greenhouse vegetables"".""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
