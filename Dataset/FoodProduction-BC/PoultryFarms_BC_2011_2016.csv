1,"The nine-digit geographic code at the end of the geographic names comprises two digits for the province, two for the census agricultural region, two for the census division and three for the census consolidated subdivision.

3,"There are significant refinements in the geographic assignment of agricultural operations and changes in census consolidated subdivision boundaries between censuses. These assignment and boundary changes mean that caution should be taken when comparing the data between censuses. This effect is particularly pronounced when comparing 2016 Census of Agriculture data to previous census data in Prince Edward Island, Quebec and the Northwest Territories.",,,,,,,,,,,
4,"Census agricultural regions are composed of groups of adjacent census divisions. Prior to 2016, in Saskatchewan, census agricultural regions were made up of groups of census consolidated subdivisions, but these groups did not necessarily respect census division boundaries.",,,,,,,,,,,
5,Broiler inventories reflect the total number of birds on Census Day and should be used with caution. Poultry inventories will fluctuate because barns that were empty on Census Day had no inventories to report. Users are advised to use the annual production data as a more accurate reflection of changes in these agricultural sectors over time.,,,,,,,,,,,
